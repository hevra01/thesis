# Arguments for the Guided Diffusion model
image_size: 256  # Size of the input image
class_cond: false  # Disable class conditioning
learn_sigma: true  # Predict both noise mean and variance
num_channels: 256  # out_channels of the first conv layer.
num_res_blocks: 2  # Number of residual blocks
num_head_channels: 64  # Channels per attention head
attention_resolutions: "32,16,8"  # Resolutions for self-attention blocks
diffusion_steps: 1000  # Sets the number of timesteps in the noise corruption (or removal) process.
# For forward, at each new timestep, the noise level increases by a constant incrementâ€”so early steps add just a bit of noise,
# progressing steadily to more noise. For backward (noise removal), we start by removing a lot of noise 
noise_schedule: linear  # Noise schedule type
resblock_updown: true  # Use residual blocks for up/down sampling
use_fp16: true  # Enable half-precision (FP16)
# the below args are same as default
num_heads: 4,
channel_mult: ''
num_heads_upsample: -1  # Number of attention heads during upsampling
dropout: 0.0  # Dropout rate
use_kl: false  # Use KL divergence loss
predict_xstart: false  
rescale_timesteps: false  # Rescale timesteps
rescale_learned_sigmas: false  # Rescale learned sigmas
use_checkpoint: false  # Use gradient checkpointing
use_scale_shift_norm: true  # Use scale-shift normalization
